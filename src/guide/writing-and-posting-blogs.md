## How to write and post blogs

Posting blogs in the platform is as easy as reading this blog. Aside from posting your own blogs, you may occasionally help other content writers by posting theirs.

Have everything like the content (word document) and the blog images at place and then follow the simple steps involved for posting:

1. Navigate to `https://formester.com/admin` and login with your credentials 
2. To post a blog click on `New Blog` button 
3. Add required fields with proper data
4. The cover image `should not be svg` and `should not exceed 300 kb` in size.
<br>
As a result, image previews will appear on all platforms when sharing the blog link

> - SVG image previews are not supported by most platforms ([source](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21636503/use-svg-as-ogimage))
> - Images larger than 300 kb are ignored by WhatsApp ([source](https://help.branch.io/faq/docs/why-are-some-quick-link-thumbnails-not-shown-in-whatsapp)) 
5. Toggle `PUBLISHED` button to save it as draft or mark it to go live
6. Use tools provided by the text editor in body to design and add content in blog
7. While adding images in blog make sure
 > - Image should be in `.png` format
 > - If using screenshots use [Pika.style](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21636503/use-svg-as-ogimage) to make it look attractive
 > - Image name should be in `blog-name__image-name` format, for example `my-first-blog__image-1` , `my-first-blog__image-2` 
8. Every image should have a good title and alt text, see here on how to write [good alt text](https://www.semrush.com/blog/alt-text/)
9. Once satisfied with your content click the `Publish` button on top and select your desired option and your blog is live.
